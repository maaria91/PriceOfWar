        <h1>The Price of War</h1>
        <p>This interactive visualizations was a project done by Maaria Assami as 
            <br /> part of the Design Studio 2 class in the Information Design and    
            <br /> Visualization MFA program during the Spring 2016 semester under the  
            <br /> instruction of Pedro Cruz. It captures the grim history surrounding the   
            <br /> different interstate wars that took place between 1823 and 2003, and 
            <br /> the blood price and casualties that was paid due to each war.
            <br />
            <br /> After hovering over the desired timeframe on the timeline, you will see the
            <br />number of wars that were fought during that period. The bloodier the 
            <br /> time period, the more the drop fills up with circles. Each circle represents a
            <br /> war with it’s area being the number of casualties, and it’s color being the 
            <br />duration of the war. You can then hover over the different circles to explore
            <br />more about the wars the different circles represent.
